        <h1>Hamilton- Rice Cooker</h1>
        <p> Each rice cooker made by Hawkins features an inside-fitting lid. This design is inherently safer than conventional cookers. To open any Hawkins cooker, you have to first lower the lid slightly into the body of the cooker; and that cannot be done until the steam pressure inside the cooker falls to a safe level. Thus Hawkins rice cookers are pressure-locked for safety - like a jetliner door!</p>
